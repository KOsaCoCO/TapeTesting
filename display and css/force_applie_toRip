Quick results (per 1 cm wide specimen)

Calculation rules used:

For materials reported as tensile strength in N/m (common for paper):
Force (N) for 1 cm width = (Tensile strength [N/m]) / 100 (because 1 m = 100 cm).

For materials reported as stress (MPa = N/mm²) (wood, coatings):
Force (N) for 1 cm width = stress [N/mm²] × cross-section area [mm²], where area = width(mm) × thickness(mm). For width = 10 mm (1 cm) area = 10 × thickness(mm).

Where tear (Elmendorf) values were the only available data I note them separately (Elmendorf is a tear-propagation energy test — not the same as tensile rupture; I show both where useful).

Wood tensile stresses widely vary by species (softwoods vs hardwoods). See FPL and veneer thickness refs.

This illustrates why tape will fail before ripping full-thickness wood. ([Forest Service Portal][7])                                                             |
| Painted wall (well-bonded paint film on substrate) — *adhesion of paint layer* |                                                      **paint film 20–150 µm** | **adhesion expressed as stress: ~0.5 — 15 MPa** → **for example**: over *1 cm²* (100 mm²) pull-off force = adhesion[ N/mm² ] × 100 (so 1 MPa → 100 N for 1 cm²). For 1 cm × 1 cm patch: **50 — 1500 N** depending on adhesion. For a 1 cm × 1 mm strip (area = 10 mm²): **5 — 150 N**. | Paint adhesion is normally reported as pull-off stress (MPa) using ASTM D4541 / ISO 4624. Good systems ≈1–10 MPa; high spec coatings are higher; poor adhesion (damaged paint) <1 MPa. See NIST, Elcometer and ISO/ASTM guidance. ([NIST Publications][8]) |
