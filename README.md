# TapeTesting
This is a locally made website with the help of AI and simple maths. To simulate real-world situations, environment behaviour, tape stickiness, tape strength, after-peel damage of new/existing tape variants. This is specifically made as a testing playground for my first Product UX RDI (research/design/innovation) case.
