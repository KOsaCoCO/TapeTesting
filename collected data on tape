Pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) tapes come in many forms. Common categories include packaging/sealing tapes (e.g. box tapes), masking/painter’s tapes, electrical/insulation tapes, cloth/duct tapes, double-sided tapes, medical tapes, foam tapes, aluminum/foil tapes, etc. Each category uses a characteristic backing and adhesive combination. For example, high-performance packaging tape typically uses a polypropylene (PP) film backing (~25–50 µm thick) coated with a hot-melt rubber-resin adhesive
multimedia.3m.com
; masking tapes use crepe or washi paper backing (~80–150 µm thick) with natural or synthetic rubber adhesive
budnick.com
; duct/gaffer tapes use cloth fabric (~200–300 µm) with rubber-based adhesive; electrical tapes often use PVC (~150–180 µm) or polyimide (Kapton) with rubber or silicone adhesives. Double-coated tapes have a thin film backing (25–100 µm) with adhesive on both sides
budnick.com
. PSA tapes require no activation (water/solvent/heat) – they adhere under light pressure.
Adhesive chemistries: Three main PSA chemistries are used. Acrylic PSAs (colorless polymers from acrylic/methacrylic monomers) offer excellent UV, aging and temperature stability (–40 °C up to +100 °C or more) and bond strongly to high-energy surfaces like metals and glass
3m.com
generalformulations.com
. Rubber-based PSAs (natural or synthetic rubber + tackifiers) give very high initial tack and can bond low-energy plastics (PE, PP), but have poorer heat/UV resistance
3m.com
3m.com
. Silicone PSAs tolerate extreme temperatures (–40 to +260 °C) and bond silicone surfaces, but are costly and have relatively low adhesion on non-silicone materials
3m.com
. (For example, 3M notes acrylic tapes “provide high or low temperature performance” and resist UV aging, whereas rubber adhesives degrade/yellow under sunlight
3m.com
3m.com
.)
Typical constructions & thicknesses: Single-coated PSA tapes usually have backing thicknesses from 25 to 250 µm (1–10 mils) and adhesive layers of 50–125 µm (2–5 mils)
budnick.com
. For instance, 3M Scotch 508 transparent tape has a 25 µm oriented-PP backing and ~15 µm acrylic adhesive (total 40 µm)
static.rapidonline.com
. Heavy-duty box tape (e.g. 3M 373) has a 41 µm PP backing plus ~23 µm hot-melt rubber adhesive (total ~64 µm)
multimedia.3m.com
. A typical paper packaging tape (tesa 60408) uses a robust paper backing (~4.92 mils/125 µm total) with natural rubber adhesive
tesa.com
. In summary, lightweight office tapes may be ~25–50 µm thick, masking tapes ~80–150 µm, packaging tapes ~60–100 µm, and specialty tapes (foil, cloth, double-sided) range up to hundreds of microns.

Other tape categories follow similar patterns: e.g. electric insulation tape is typically PVC-backed with rubber adhesive (thickness ~150 µm); gaffer’s tape is cloth-backed (~200 µm) with natural rubber adhesive; foil tapes use 25–50 µm metal foil with acrylic adhesive; double-sided tapes often use PET film (25–50 µm) with adhesive on both sides.
Adhesion on Different Surfaces
Adhesion depends on both adhesive type and surface energy/texture. Metals and glass are high-energy surfaces, so most adhesives (acrylic or rubber) bond strongly. For example, acrylic PSAs readily wet and bind to aluminum, steel or glass
generalformulations.com
. Textured or porous surfaces (e.g. wood, rough concrete, corrugated cardboard) require the adhesive to flow into valleys; manufacturers often increase adhesive thickness to ensure contact (3M suggests ~125 µm adhesive layer for visibly textured surfaces
multimedia.3m.com
). Smooth plastic (low-energy substrates like polyethylene, polypropylene, or glossy photos) are harder to bond; specialized LSE adhesives or surface primers are used. Rubber PSAs can adhere to some low-energy plastics
generalformulations.com
, whereas acrylic PSAs usually need pretreatment for PE/PP
generalformulations.com
. Surface examples: steel/aluminium – very good bonding. Glass – high bond (acrylic PSAs excel). Textured glass or painted surfaces – adhesives must conform to the roughness; delicate tapes (like 2080) use low-tack adhesives to prevent paint damage
objects.icecat.biz
. Paper (sketchbook, manga, cheap copy paper) and wood (door veneer) have high surface energy but can absorb adhesives; bonding is generally strong due to mechanical interlock. However, on fresh or damaged paint, even a small bit of moisture or a weak paint film can cause adhesives to lift underlying paint; thus painter’s tapes are formulated for 24h-old paint only
objects.icecat.biz
. For photographic prints (e.g. Instax), adhesives must be acid-free/archival to avoid image degradation – standard tapes are not photo-safe (special mounting tapes are recommended).
Environmental Effects
Temperature and humidity strongly influence PSA performance. In cold conditions (<15 °C), adhesives stiffen and lose tack, yielding weak bonds
ppmindustries.com
. In hot conditions (>30–35 °C), adhesives soften too quickly: bonds may form fast but lack cohesive strength over time
ppmindustries.com
. Humidity adds complexity: moisture can form a micro-barrier on porous substrates (wood, paper, painted walls) that prevents full wet-out
ppmindustries.com
. In practice, tapes perform best when applied in moderate climates (~15–25 °C, 40–60% RH)
ppmindustries.com
ppmindustries.com
. Studies show that long-term aging under cyclic humid heat has less effect on adhesive thickness than on peel strength, and even then surface type dominated the results
mdpi.com
. For example, one building-study found peel adhesion varied widely (11–61 N/24 mm) mainly due to substrate differences, not the number of humidity/heat cycles
mdpi.com
. Nonetheless, in tropical (25–35 °C, 75–95% RH) or humid (15–25 °C, 70–90% RH) climates, tapes can suffer reduced tack and bond failure if moisture remains on the surface
ppmindustries.com
. In arid (25–40 °C, 10–30% RH) or dry (18–25 °C, 20–40% RH) climates, humidity is low so bonding surfaces stay dry, but high heat can accelerate adhesive flow and eventual creep or residue. In all cases, best practice is to condition both tape and substrate to ambient conditions before bonding. For example, 3M notes the ideal lamination temperature is 15–38 °C; below ~10 °C adhesion is “too firm” to apply readily
multimedia.3m.com
. After bonding, environmental exposure (UV, temperature cycles, moisture) will gradually age the adhesive. Acrylic-based tapes are chosen for UV and heat stability (e.g. can withstand 250 °F / 120 °C
engineeredmaterialsinc.com
), whereas rubber-based tapes degrade faster in sun and humidity
3m.com
. Silicone tapes remain stable even at very high temperatures (up to 260 °C
3m.com
). Storage of finished rolls also matters: manufacturers typically recommend ~20 °C, ~50% RH to preserve tape performance
static.rapidonline.com
multimedia.3m.com
. For instance, Scotch 508 and 373 should be stored at ~20 °C/50% RH (3M 373: 4–27 °C, 40–50% RH
multimedia.3m.com
). Extended storage in hot/wet or very dry/freezing conditions can reduce tack and cohesion.
Raw Material Handling and Shelf Life
Raw adhesive polymers and backing materials must also be protected. PSA adhesives (monomers, tackifiers, solvents) are typically stored sealed at ~15–25 °C in dry conditions. Exceeding ~25 °C can cause premature curing or solvent loss; below ~15 °C some formulations crystallize or become very viscous
forgeway.com
chempoint.com
. Therefore, industry advice is to keep adhesives “between 15 °C and 25 °C”
forgeway.com
 and strictly capped to prevent moisture ingress
chempoint.com
. Two-component (epoxy/urethane) adhesives should have lids closed or be stored upright to avoid moisture contamination or hardening
forgeway.com
chempoint.com
. Backing films and papers should be kept out of direct sunlight and moisture (to avoid degradation, mold or dimensional changes). In practice, raw tapes (finished rolls) are handled as “articles” – they carry no SDS unless an adhesive component is hazardous. For example, 3M notes their tape products are TSCA-exempt articles, so no SDS is required
multimedia.3m.com
. Nonetheless, users are advised to stock-rolls FIFO and avoid using tapes beyond their rated shelf life. Typical shelf lives are on the order of 1–3 years. For example, 3M Scotch 508 specifies 1 year at 20 °C/50% RH
static.rapidonline.com
, and 3M 373 recommends 18 months at 4–27 °C/40–50% RH
multimedia.3m.com
. Longer storage (especially in warm/humid conditions) can cause adhesives to lose tack or backings to yellow. Quality systems (e.g. ISO 9001) ensure products are made and packaged to meet specifications until expiry.
Regulatory and Certifications
Tapes and adhesives are subject to many industry standards. Major tape manufacturers (3M, Tesa, Nitto, etc.) operate under ISO 9001 quality systems
multimedia.3m.com
. Materials must comply with chemical regulations (REACH, RoHS) and workplace safety (OSHA, SDS). For example, 3M states that its tapes conform to global environmental and safety rules and provides REACH/RoHS information on request
multimedia.3m.com
. Many tapes are UL/CSA certified: electrical insulation tapes meet ANSI/UL 510/510A and CSA C22.2 No.197 standards. Building/sealing tapes may carry fire/smoke classification (e.g. ASTM E84/UL 723). Food-contact tapes (packaging) often comply with FDA indirect-food-contact guidelines (3M 373 does so, per its data). Archival/photo tapes are acid-free and often certified for lignin/pH to protect images. Some tape products have special labels – e.g. tesa 60408 is DIN CERTCO-certified 92% bio-based
tesa.com
. In general, adhesive tapes must be tested and labeled per applicable regional standards (e.g. Afera guidelines in Europe, UL/ASTM in US), and safety data (SDS) is provided when required. Sources: Manufacturer technical data sheets and product bulletins

 were used to compile these specifications.
